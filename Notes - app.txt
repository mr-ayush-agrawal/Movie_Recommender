To Run the code we need to (streamlit rum app.py) in the terminal

For making the webpage we are using the module -> StreamLit
    We are prefering it over the other module like Flask and Django as this is easy to Use
    The Web page could also be created using those module
    The Referance video was making using this So I also decided to do that

We are loading the data that we have created while making the model.
    We have dumped it using pkl, so we will load using similar technique

We are putting the select Box, BUTTON in the webpage
